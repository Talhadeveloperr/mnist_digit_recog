# 🧠 MNIST Digit Recognition Web App

A professional web application to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), using machine learning models with `GridSearchCV` for optimal performance. The app is built with **Streamlit** and deployed for real-time usage.
